## Grading

All grading in this course will be through self-assessment on the Codekwondo learning platform.

### Cheating

Cheating in the class results in immediate failure of the course. What constitutes cheating? One example would be trying to deliver a duplicate of someone else's assignment, when it's not a group project. As a general rule though, if it feels dishonest, it's cheating. If there's something you're not sure about, ask me first to make sure.

### Not Trying

I really, *really* want each and every one of you to succeed. In fact, I'm more than happy to put in a lot of time outside of class giving you feedback and answering questions. And there are *never* too many questions. In order to make this time though, I make less time for people who don't try.

Here's what trying looks like:

- Show up
- Ask for help when you need it
- Don't lie to me

If you do those things, I will bend over backwards to help you. And to ensure that I can *make that time* to help you, **I have a 3 strikes rule.** When you earn 3 strikes, you fail the course (unless there are very special circumstances). These are the activities that could earn you a strike:

#### Missed deadlines

In a real job, your boss probably isn't going to dock your pay for not meeting a deadline. So I'm not detracting any points. If you're going to miss a deadline though, I'd like to hear from you explaining why *beforehand*, with a plan for how you'll avoid missing deadlines in the future.

If I *don't* hear from you, I'll worry and check in to make sure you're OK. I really want you to succeed. I also have to give you a strike though. Just like in a real job, it's unacceptable to simply not do work, hoping your boss doesn't notice.

#### Submitting incomplete work

Similarly, if you submit a project that *clearly* doesn't meet the criteria, that's a strike. I want to give you really great feedback, but if I keep having to hand out really obvious feedback, like "Umm... it's not done," then that's less time I have for people who really want to grow.

### Absences

Absences have a separate 3-strike policy. We'll be doing a lot of our work online, but we'll also be doing a lot of work in class. The rule is 3 absences, explained or not, and you fail the course (again, unless there are very special circumstances). If you're more than 5 minutes late, that's counts for half an absence. We only have 14 classes. If you miss 3 of them, that's over 20%. What job are you allowed to not show up for 20% of the time?
